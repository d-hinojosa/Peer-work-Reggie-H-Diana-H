Arrays In-Class Activity

1. What types of data can be stored in an array?

2. What is an associative array?

3. What is a multidimensional array?

4. Code Activity-1
Create two arrays.  Name the first array ‘odd’ have it contain only the old numbers from 1 to 10.  Name the second array ‘even’ have it contain only the even numbers from 1 to 10.
Combine the two arrays ( odd & even) into a new array named ‘allNums’
Use an alert and pull out the number 9.  Use an alert to pull out the number 4.

5. Code Activity-2
Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:
 var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses","ostriches"];
      b.  Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o".
If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

    	 	HINT: You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element 
of an array.

6. Code Activity-3
Given the array below write code to join all elements of the array into a string
 var rvColors = ["red", "black", "grey", "white"];
